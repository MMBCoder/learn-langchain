st.write('''
There is no better way to learn a new language or framework than going hands-on and build
your own tools using LangChain and Artificial Intelligence! Theory is never enough, you
need to confront yourself with real-life use cases, write code, get stuck and figure out
solutions. In this section you will find some demo project I built specifically for this
course, that resemble scenarios that may come useful for many companies, or can be extended
to create interesting tools!

All the projects are open-source and you will find a link to the code on GitHub!

AIs know lots of information, but they do not have access to our private archives, email
conversations, chats, work documents, etc... In this demo we will see how to build a system

Let's see how we can easly summarize web content using a purpose-specific chain, and how we
can take advantage of different chain types to produce diverse outcomes and get around LLM

With this demo we start going beyond the "made-to-learn" tutorials, creating a tool
