Now that we have a good understanding of LLMs and Prompt Templates, we are ready to
introduce chains, the most important core component of LangChain. Chains are pre-built
classes that allow us to combine LLMs and Prompts together, with a modular approach
designed to facilitate the creation of complex language processing pipelines while
keeping our codebase solid and readable.

LangChain provides chains for the most
common operations (routing, sequential execution, document analysis) as well as
advanced chains for working with custom data, handling memory and so on. Also, we
will see more advanced LangChain features (tokenizers, transformers, embeddings)
that are much easier to use with chains.

We could, but implementing it in steps offer several advantages:
- better debugging and more control over the LLM responses
- better responses due to more concise and specific prompts
- more flexibility if we want dynamically assign new steps to different chains (Router Chain)
