LLMs are stateless by default, meaning that they have no built-in memory. But sometimes
we need memory to implement applications such like conversational systems, which may have
to remember previous information provided by the user. Fortunately, LangChain provides
several memory management solutions, suitable for different use cases.

We have seen beofre as vector stores are referred as long-term memory, instead, the methods
we will see in this secion are considered short-term memory, as they do not persist after
the interactions are complete.

This is the simplest memory class and basically what it does, is to include previous messages
in the new LLM prompt. You can try to have a conversation with the chatbot, then ask questions

Of course, the conversation can get long and including all the chat instory in the prompt can
become inefficient and expensive, because longest prompts result in a highest LLM token usage.
To optimize this behavior, LangChain provides three other types of memory. The

has to remember, using a simple parameter:
