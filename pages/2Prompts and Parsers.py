Prompts are another key component in LangChain and in general in Large Language Models.
A well structured prompt can make all the difference in getting a quality outcome from

- Clarity: some prompts can be long and detailed, setting them up as template will make your code better.
- Reusability: many times you will be able to reuse existing templates with a few code changes.
- Simplicity: LangChain has some pre-built templates for common operations (We'll have a look at this later on).
- Security: by limiting user control to the needed inputs, we minimize the risk of misusing our LLM.
- Output: you can instruct the LLM to return data with specific keywords, and parse the output as structured data instead of plain text to fit you app needs.

This last point brings us to the next LangChain component: output parsers.

By default, LLMs return responses as plain text which is not very useful when developing complex applications
that have to interpret the data and take decisions based on those outputs. Fortunately, LangChain provides 
useful output parser classes which play well with prompts templates and can convert text data in any format we
need based on custom lofic and instructions. Let's see an example:
